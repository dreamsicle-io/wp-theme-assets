# WPGulp

A simple, zero configuration Gulp build &amp; lint setup for developing modern WordPress themes. This setup will build and optimize SASS, JavaScript, language localizations, and images. 

## File structure

This gulp setup has zero configuration, however it does expect that your project root's package.json is setup properly, and that an oppinionated file structure is followed. The localization tasks are handled by the built in WordPress i18n functions in all theme `.php` files, but the source assets should be structured accordingly.

```
root
- assets
-- src
--- js
--- sass
--- images
```

**After Build** 

```
root
- assets
-- dist (generated by build)
--- js (generated by build)
--- css (generated by build)
--- images (generated by build)
-- src
--- js
--- sass
--- images
- languages (generated by build)
```
